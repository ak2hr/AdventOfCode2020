- need to know where cup 1 is
- need to know which two cups are to the right of cup 1

- check and see if cycle repeats in a pattern
- check and see if the position of a cup moves in a distinguishable way
- check and see if an index is filled by cups with a pattern
- break down the rules and see if there's something special about them

- wants cup 1 and two cups next to it. Something to do with when three cups are picked up?
- cups next to 1 change when:
	- 1 is picked up, but is not first to be picked up
	- 1 is curCup, so three cups next to 1 are picked up
	- 1 is destination cup
	- the cup right next to 1 is destination cup
- when 1 is curCup, potential destination cups decrease from 1 million

- HAVE to keep track of where all of the cups are in order to handle picking up cups, destination cup location, etc

- if cups to left of curCup is curCup - 1, the three cups right of curCup get picked up and placed directly behind curCup, so basically curCup itself just gets picked up and moved forward 3 spaces
- can maybe use this to speed up process?

-instead of a list, use a dictionary where each key is a cup, and the value for that key is the cup that it points to
